## Subglacial overdeepenings
This dataset contains the results of a study published in Frontiers of Earth Sciences (DOI)
by Furian et al. (2022) and provides information on glacial lake development in
High Mountain Asia until 2100 following four different SSP scenarios.

Files are based on the code available in the
[Code](https://github.com/cryotools/glacial-lake-evolution/tree/main/code)
section. 

### Metadata

| *sinkNr* | Potential lake ID, unique per glacier |
| *Volume* | Volume of the exposed lake part (m³) |
