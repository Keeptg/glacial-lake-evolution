## Projected 21st century glacial lake evolution in High Mountain Asia
### Introduction
With this dataset, we present estimates for future glacial lake development 
in High Mountain Asia (HMA) with unprecedented temporal resolution. 
For the development, we relied on an ensemble of fifteen global climate models 
using the newest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) data 
and employed a set of four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. 

The results are a comprehensive overview on spatial and temporal 
future lake developments in HMA until 2100. They form the basis for 
more localized approaches to further investigate locations 
at which a timely formation of hazardous glacial lakes is likely to occur. 
This dataset can be used to identify a timeframe for the 
necessary development and implementation of mitigation measures at locations
of currently or potentially dangerous glacial lakes. 

The related study is part of the [GLAMoR](https://hu.berlin/glamor) project 
(Future **G**lacial **L**akes in High Mountain **A**sia -
**Mo**deling and **R**isk Analysis) at the Geography Department of 
Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. The results of the study will soon be published in 
Frontiers in Earth Sciences as part of the Research Topic 
"Lake Changes, Drivers and Consequences in High Mountain Asia".

### Ressources
This study builds on several resources and previously published datasets:

- the [Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM)](https.//oggm.org) for the glacier modeling
- the specific OGGM outputs used in our study are available [here](https://cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~fmaussion/lt_archive/run_hma_hr_cmip6_v1)
- glacier outlines from the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://doi.org/10.7265/N5-RGI-60)
- the inventory of subglacial overdeepenings in HMA (by [Furian et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2021.18))
